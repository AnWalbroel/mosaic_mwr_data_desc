Listing the scripts and their purposes:
NN_retrieval_miracp.py: Training and application of a Neural Network retrieval to derive integrated water vapour from the microwave radiometer MiRAC-P. Training data consists of ERA-I reanalysis (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5846394). Furthermore, the brightness temperature data measured by MiRAC-P (DOI_MIRAC_P_TB) during the MOSAiC expedition (https://doi.org/10.25923/9g3v-xh92) are required. When running the code with "python3 NN_retrieval_miracp.py 'finalized'" the DOI_MIRAC_P_L2 data is created. When running it with "python3 NN_retrieval_miracp.py '20_runs'" metrics mentioned in the DOI_PUBLICATION can be found.

data_tools.py: Module containing data analysis routines called by other scripts.

import_data.py: Module containing various importer routines called by other scripts.

met_tools.py: Module containing meteorological computations (humidity conversion, ...) called by other scripts

my_classes.py: Classes called by other scripts

case_study_overview_mwr_radiosonde.py: Script to generate Figure 6 of DOI_PUBLICATION. Uses DOI_HATPRO_L2, DOI_MIRAC_P_L2, netCDF version of https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.928656 (converted with PANGAEA_tab_to_nc.py).

mwr_pro_output_add_geoinfo.py: Adding Polarstern track data (https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.924668, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.924674, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.924681, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.926829, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.926910 <<-- as netCDF versions, converted with PANGAEA_tab_to_nc.py) to HATPRO files (DOI_HATPRO_L1, DOI_HATPRO_L2).

PANGAEA_tab_to_nc.py: Script to convert PANGAEA radiosonde (https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.928656) and Polarstern track data (see above) to netCDF format (.nc).

plot_mwr_level_2a_radiosonde.py: Script to generate Figures 1, 2, and 3 of DOI_PUBLICATION. Uses DOI_HATPRO_L2, DOI_MIRAC_P_L2, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.928656 (netCDF version from PANGAEA_tab_to_nc.py).

plot_mwr_level_2bc_radiosonde.py: Script to generate Figures 4, and 5 of DOI_PUBLICATION. Uses DOI_HATPRO_L2 and https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.928656 (netCDF version from PANGAEA_tab_to_nc.py).
